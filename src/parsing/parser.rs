/*!
A parser owns the `OperatorTable` and parses the expression grammar, building a syntax tree along
the way. Because the `OperatorTable` drives the control flow of the parsing algorithm, the
`OperatorTable` and `Parser` are tightly coupled, with `OperatorTable` being a data structure
only and `Parser` holding all methods.

This design is an evolution of that described by Theodore Norvell, which itself is very similar to
the standard object oriented design and Pratt's original description. In the original design,
information about operators are stored in a table during runtime, and there are facilities for
loading, managing, and searching this table.

Norvell describes three tables: `LeftCommand`, `NullCommand`, and "Other." The "Command" suffix is
historical and refers to what command the parsing algorithm should take when it encounters a
particular token. `LeftCommand` holds data about operators that take a operand on their left.
Operators in `NullCommand` *start* expressions.

L (left) tokens:  Takes a left operand (binary ops, postfix ops).
                  L tokens are those directly consumed by the E procedure.
N (null) tokens:  No left operand (prefix ops and variables).
                  N tokens are those that are used to make the initial
                  choice in the P procedure and that are then consumed as
                  opposed to leading to an error being reported
O (other) tokens: All other tokens: ), ], etc.

See Theodore S. Norvell, "From Precedence Climbing to Pratt Parsing," 2016:
https://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/pratt_parsing.htm

The present design differs in several ways:
  1. Operator data is stored in a single table.
  2. An operator may have any (or all) of L-, N-, and O-tokens. If an operator has no token of a
     category, the column for that category is set to NULL.
  3. Methods for parsing operators are moved out of operator (sub)classes and into the `Parser`
     with the rest of the parsing code. This not only consolidates the parsing code but also
     separates the concerns of describing data about an operator from the parsing algorithm.

// Todo: Error handling is a mess. There is no consistency. Need to distinguish errors that happen _inside_ the
//       session and errors that happen when executing an otherwise valid session.

// Todo: The `Parser` struct holds very little state. Investigate the feasibility of not having a `Parser` struct at
//       all. Already most methods should be free functions. Alternatively, does it make more sense to hold more
//       state in `Parser` instead of passing state around? Issue is dependent on error handling design.

// Todo: Think about whether or not there is a better code factorization between `left_denotation` and
//       `null_denotation`, as they differ only in which operator types they match on.
