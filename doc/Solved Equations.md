 A solved equation is an abstract representation of a set of substitutions, which are said to be _generated_ by the
solved equation. Solved sets are sets of equations, whose elements are called solved equations.  Solved equations
have one of six possible forms:

 1. x ≈ t
 2. 𝗫 ≈ g
 3. x̅ ≈ r̃
 4. x̅̅ ≈ ⸨r̃⸩
 5. x̅̅ ≈ t̃[f]
 6. x̅̅̅ ≈ ⸨t̃⸩[f]

where ⸨•⸩ denotes multisets. If eq is a solved equation, then ∑(eq) is the set of substitutions generated by eq. It
is these ∑(eq) that correspond to `MatchGenerator`s. The sets of substitutions generated by each solved equation are
summarized in the table below.

|      | Solved Equation |                     ∑(eq) = | Substitutions Generated by the Solved Equation               |
| ---- | --------------- | --------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.   | x ≈ t           |                  ∑(x ≈ t) = | {{x ⟼ t}}                                                    |
| 2.   | 𝗫 ≈ f           |                  ∑(𝗫 ≈ f) = | {{𝗫 ⟼ f}}                                                    |
| 3.   | x̅ ≈ t̃           |                ∑( x̅ ≈ t̃ ) = | {{ x̅ ⟼ t̃ }}                                                  |
| 4.   | x̅̅ ≈ ⸨r̃⸩         |    ∑( x̅̅ ≈ ⸨t₁, t₂,…,tₙ⸩ ) = | {{x̅̅ ⟼ (tᵩ₍₁₎, tᵩ₍₂₎,…,tᵩ₍ₙ₎)} \| where 𝜑 is a permutation of (1,...,n) } |
| 5.   | x̅̅ ≈ t̃[f]        | ∑( x̅̅ ≈ (t₁, t₂,…,tₙ)[f] ) = | {{x ⟼ r̃} \| where f(t₁, t₂,…,tₙ) ≐ f( r̃ ), A(f),  r̃ is in A-normal form } |
| 6.   | x̅̅̅ ≈ ⸨t̃⸩[f]      |           ∑( x̅̅̅ ≈ ⸨t̃⸩[f] ) = | {{x ⟼ r̃} \| where f(tᵩ₍₁₎, tᵩ₍₂₎,…,tᵩ₍ₙ₎) ≐ f( r̃ ), A(f), 𝜑 is a permutation of (1,...,n),  r̃ is in AC-normal form} |
