# Solved Equations and Substitutions 

In the first versions of this codebase, the implementation of Algorithm LM (Linear Matching) produced what we called 
"match generators," which iterate over every possible substitution that could be produced by applying a matching 
rule to a match equation. We call the _set_ of all substitutions generated by a match generator a _Substitution Set_.

It is possible to have a set of transformation rules that produce substitution sets of infinite size. We have
carefully designed our transformation rules to produce substitution sets of finite size. If we hadn't, we would have 
had a match generator that would never be exhausted. Still, it may be useful to have a formalism corresponding to 
transformation rules that produce substitution sets of infinite size in order to study such systems. The idea is to 
use what we call a Solved Equation to represent the (possibly infinite) set of substitutions that can be produced by 
applying a transformation rule. Solutions to sets of matching equations will then be representable by a finite 
collection of Solved Equations each of which correspond to a well-defined set of substitutions.
