# The Evaluation Sequence

This is the sequence used by Mathematica to evaluate an expression
`h[e1, e2, e3,…]`.

1. If the expression is a raw object (e.g., `Integer`, `String`, etc.), leave
it unchanged.
2. Evaluate the head `h` of the expression.
3. Evaluate each element `ei` of the expression in turn. If `h`
is a symbol with attributes `HoldFirst`, `HoldRest`, `HoldAll`, or
`HoldAllComplete`, then skip evaluation of certain elements.
4. Unless `h` has attributes `SequenceHold` or `HoldAllComplete`, flatten out all
Sequence objects that appear among the ei.
5. Unless `h` has attribute `HoldAllComplete`, strip the outermost of any
`Unevaluated` wrappers that appear among the ei.
6. If `h` has attribute `Flat`, then flatten out all nested expressions with
head `h`.
7. If `h` has attribute `Listable`, then thread through any `ei` that are lists.
8. If `h` has attribute `Orderless`, then sort the `ei` into order.
9. Unless `h` has attribute `HoldAllComplete`, use any applicable
transformation rules associated with `f` that you have defined for objects of the form `h[f[e1,…],…]`.
10. Use any built‐in transformation rules associated with `f` for objects of
the form `h[f[e1,…],…]`.
11. Use any applicable transformation rules that you have defined for
`h[f[e1,e2,…],…]` or for `h[…][…]`.
12. Use any built‐in transformation rules for `h[e1,e2,…]` or for `h[…][…]`.


## Evaluation

Suppose node `A` has a child node `B`: `A[B]`.

```
A[.]
  |
  B
```

(Recall that a `Sequence` is not itself an expression, so only functions have
children.)

### "Normal" evaluation

The active context is queried for ``A``'s `SymbolRecord`. If the `Attributes`
found in the `SymbolRecord` for `A` do not have `HoldFirst` or `HoldRest`
set, then "normal" evalaution is triggered.

Evaluation proceeds in post-order: When a node A is evaluated, first all of
A's children are evaluated, then A is evaluated. In particular, B is evaluated
first. There are several possibilities:

1. `B` is a `Real`, `Integer`, or `StringLiteral`. These evaluate to themselves, so
their evaluation is a no-op.
2. `B` is a `Variable` or `SequenceVariable`. These evaluate to themselves, so
their evaluation is a no-op.

3. `B` is a Symbol. The active context is queried for ``B``'s `SymbolRecord`.
   If `B` has an `own_value`, `B` is substituted for the `own_value`,
   and evaluation of `B` ends. If `B` has an `up_value`, the `up_value`
   is pattern-matched against `A[B]`. If the pattern match succeeds,
   it will result in a) a set of replacements for the RHS of the up_value,
   and b) a replacement for `A[B]`. Once this replacement is performed, the
   new expression is evaluated again.

4. `B` is a function. Start these evaluation steps again, with `B` in the
   role of `A`.

Now assume `B` has been fully evaluated to become expression `C`. Then we have

```
A
|
C
```

The active context is queried for ``A``'s `SymbolRecord`. If `A` has any
`up_alues` (and a parent), they are pattern-matched in analogy to `B` above.
Otherwise, if `A` has any `down_values`, they are pattern-matched against `A`.

## Substitution

Imagine the function definition

```
f[x_, y_] := x + y^2
```

This function definition produces a `down_value` for `f`. Suppose we evaluate
the expression `f[1, 2]`. The LHS of the `down_value` `f[x_, y_]` is pattern
matched against `f[1, 2]` resulting in the solution set `{x_->1, y_->2}` This
solution set is a set of substitutions. Note that these variables correspond
to symbols on the RHS: the symbol `x` on the RHS is replaced with the
replacement value for `x_` in the solution set.

The RHS of the `down_value` is instantiated, and the substitutions are
applied, yielding `1+2^2`. The original expression is finally replaced
with this new expression. If the original and new expressions are equal,
evaluation stops. Otherwise evaluation is restarted with the new expression.
